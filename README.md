** These project classifies breast tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It involves data preprocessing, training a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras, and evaluating model accuracy. The model shows potential for real-world application in cancer diagnostics with point-based predictions.
